Based on the provided Angular template, here is a list of the variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that would be needed in the corresponding TypeScript file to make the template functional:

### Variables:
1. `settings`: `Array<{ userId: string; permissionLevel: string; }>` - An array of objects representing the shared settings, where each object contains a `userId` and a `permissionLevel`.

2. `permissionLevels`: `string[]` - An array of available permission levels that can be assigned to a user.

### Constants:
1. There are no explicit constants defined in the template, but if we consider the column names for a hypothetical `mat-table` that might be related to this dialog, we could have constants like:
   - `USER_COLUMN`: `string` - The name of the column displaying the user's name.
   - `PERMISSION_COLUMN`: `string` - The name of the column displaying the permission level.

### ViewChild:
There are no `ViewChild` references indicated in the provided template. However, if there were elements in the template that needed to be accessed directly in the TypeScript file, they would be listed here.

### Functions:
1. `update.emit(settings: Array<{ userId: string; permissionLevel: string; }>)`: `void` - A function that emits an event with the updated settings when the 'Update' button is clicked. This would typically be an `@Output` EventEmitter in the component.

### Pipes:
1. `userName`: `PipeTransform` - A custom pipe that transforms a `userId` into a user's name.
2. `permissionLevelTranslation`: `PipeTransform` - A custom pipe that translates permission levels into their Japanese equivalents.
3. `translate`: `PipeTransform` - A custom pipe that translates static text into Japanese.

### Additional Notes:
- The `mat-dialog-title` and `mat-dialog-actions` are Angular Material directives and do not require explicit definitions in the TypeScript file.
- The `[(value)]` binding on `mat-select` indicates a two-way data binding, which suggests that the `settings` array objects' `permissionLevel` property will be updated in the component's TypeScript file when the user selects a different option.
- The `mat-dialog-close` directive on the 'Cancel' button is part of Angular Material's API and does not require a specific function in the TypeScript file, but the dialog component should be configured to close when this button is clicked.

This list assumes that the Angular component is set up correctly with the necessary imports and that the Angular Material modules are imported into the application module.
