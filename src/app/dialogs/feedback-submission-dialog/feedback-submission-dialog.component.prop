Here's a list of the potential variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that might be needed in the TypeScript file to support the Angular template provided:

1. Variables:
   - `feedbackInputValue: string` - This variable would hold the current value of the feedback input field.

2. Constants:
   - `CANCEL_LABEL: string` - This constant would hold the translation key for the "キャンセル" text, which is used for the cancel button label.
   - `SEND_LABEL: string` - This constant would hold the translation key for the "送信" text, which is used for the send button label.

3. ViewChild:
   - `feedbackInput: ElementRef` - This is a reference to the textarea element where the user inputs their feedback. It is used to access the value and validation state of the input.

4. Functions:
   - `onSubmit(): void` - This function would be called when the user submits the form. It would handle the logic for what happens when the feedback is submitted.
   - `isFeedbackValid(): boolean` - This function would return a boolean indicating whether the feedback input is valid or not. It could be used to enable or disable the send button.

5. i18n (Internationalization):
   - If using Angular's i18n, you might not have explicit variables or constants for translations, as the translations are handled by the framework and the `translate` pipe. However, if you're using a custom translation service, you might have something like:
     - `translations: { [key: string]: string }` - An object or service that provides translations for the given keys.

Please note that the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and architecture of the Angular application. The `mat-error` directive suggests that there might be additional logic to handle form validation, which could involve Angular's `FormControl` or `FormGroup` classes. The `[disabled]` binding on the send button also implies that there is some logic to determine when the button should be enabled or disabled based on the input value.
