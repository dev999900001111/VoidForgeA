To create the TypeScript component that corresponds to the provided Angular template, we would need to define several properties and methods to handle the dialog interactions and possibly to manage the state of the version being reverted to. Below is a list of potential variables, constants, ViewChild references, and functions that might be needed:

1. Variables:
   - `selectedVersion: string` - Holds the version number (e.g., "X.Y") that the user has selected to revert to.

2. Constants:
   - `COLUMN_NAMES: string[]` - An array of strings representing the column names if there is a mat-table involved elsewhere in the component (not shown in the provided HTML).

3. ViewChild:
   - There is no explicit need for a ViewChild in the provided template since there are no child components or elements that need to be accessed directly from the TypeScript code. However, if there were elements that needed direct access, they would be listed here with their respective types and descriptions.

4. Functions:
   - `onCancel(): void` - A function to handle the cancellation of the revert action. It would typically close the dialog without performing any action.
   - `onRevert(): void` - A function to handle the confirmation of the revert action. It would close the dialog and trigger the process to revert the project to the selected version.

5. Additional Angular Material Dialog Data (if needed):
   - `dialogRef: MatDialogRef<YourDialogComponent>` - A reference to the dialog itself, which allows for closing the dialog programmatically and passing data back to the component that opened the dialog.
   - `data: any` - If the dialog needs to receive data (like the version number), this would be injected into the component through the MAT_DIALOG_DATA token.

Here's an example of how these might be declared in a TypeScript component class:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MatDialogRef, MAT_DIALOG_DATA } from '@angular/material/dialog';

const COLUMN_NAMES: string[] = ['version', 'date', 'actions']; // Example column names

@Component({
  selector: 'app-version-revert-dialog',
  templateUrl: './version-revert-dialog.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./version-revert-dialog.component.css']
})
export class VersionRevertDialogComponent {
  selectedVersion: string; // The version to revert to

  constructor(
    public dialogRef: MatDialogRef<VersionRevertDialogComponent>,
    @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA) public data: any
  ) {
    this.selectedVersion = data.version; // Assuming the version is passed in as data
  }

  onCancel(): void {
    this.dialogRef.close();
  }

  onRevert(): void {
    this.dialogRef.close(true);
  }
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements of the application and the context in which the dialog is used.
