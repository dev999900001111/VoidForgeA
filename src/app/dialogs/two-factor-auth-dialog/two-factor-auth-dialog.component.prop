Here's a list of the required variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that would be needed in the TypeScript file to support the provided Angular template:

Variables:
1. `data: { qrCodeUrl: string }` - An object containing the QR code URL to be displayed in the image source.
2. `error: string` - A string to hold error messages that may occur during the verification process.

Constants:
1. There are no explicit constants defined in the HTML template for mat-table column names. However, if you were to include a mat-table, you would define constants for the column names like so:
   - `DISPLAYED_COLUMNS: string[]` - An array of strings representing the column names to be displayed in a mat-table.

ViewChild:
1. There are no explicit `ViewChild` references in the provided HTML template. However, if you wanted to access the input field directly from the TypeScript code, you could use:
   - `@ViewChild('verificationCodeInput') verificationCodeInputElement: ElementRef` - A reference to the input element for the verification code.

Functions:
1. `verifyCode(verificationCode: string): void` - A function that takes the verification code input by the user and processes it for verification.

Please note that the actual implementation details, such as the logic within the `verifyCode` function or how the `error` variable is set, are not provided in the HTML template and would need to be implemented based on the specific requirements of the application. Additionally, if there are any other interactions or dynamic behaviors expected from the template, corresponding properties and methods would need to be added to the TypeScript file.
