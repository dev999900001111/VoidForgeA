To create the TypeScript component class for the provided Angular template, we would need to define the following:

### Variables:
1. `save: EventEmitter<void>`, type: `EventEmitter<void>`, description: An Angular `EventEmitter` that emits an event when the save button is clicked.
2. `publish: EventEmitter<void>`, type: `EventEmitter<void>`, description: An Angular `EventEmitter` that emits an event when the publish button is clicked.

### Constants:
There are no explicit constants in the provided HTML snippet. However, if we consider the mat-table's column names as constants, they are not provided in the snippet, so we cannot list them.

### ViewChild:
There are no `ViewChild` or `ViewChildren` directives in the provided HTML snippet, so none are needed for this component.

### Functions:
There are no explicit functions defined in the HTML snippet. However, the `(click)` event bindings suggest that there should be functions or methods in the TypeScript class that are called when the buttons are clicked. Since the event bindings are directly emitting events, we do not necessarily need separate functions unless additional logic is required on button click.

However, if we were to define functions for clarity, they might look like this:

1. `onSave()`, type: `function`, description: A function that is called when the save button is clicked. It emits the `save` event.
2. `onPublish()`, type: `function`, description: A function that is called when the publish button is clicked. It emits the `publish` event.

Here is an example of how the TypeScript code might look:

```typescript
import { Component, EventEmitter, Output } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-save-publish-dialog',
  templateUrl: './save-publish-dialog.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./save-publish-dialog.component.css']
})
export class SavePublishDialogComponent {
  @Output() save = new EventEmitter<void>();
  @Output() publish = new EventEmitter<void>();

  constructor() {}

  onSave(): void {
    this.save.emit();
  }

  onPublish(): void {
    this.publish.emit();
  }
}
```

In this example, the `onSave` and `onPublish` methods are defined for clarity, but they are not strictly necessary since the event bindings could directly call `save.emit()` and `publish.emit()` as shown in the HTML snippet.
