Based on the provided Angular template snippet, here are the potential variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that might be needed in the corresponding TypeScript file to make this template functional. Note that some assumptions are made due to the lack of context.

### Variables:
1. `message`: string - This variable holds the message text to be displayed within the `<mat-dialog-content>`.

### Constants:
1. `CANCEL_LABEL`: string - This constant represents the translation key for the 'キャンセル' text, which is used for the cancel button label.
2. `CONFIRM_LABEL`: string - This constant represents the translation key for the '確認' text, which is used for the confirm button label.

### ViewChild:
No `ViewChild` is evident from the provided template. `ViewChild` is used to access a child component, directive, or DOM element from the parent component class, and there is no indication of such usage in the snippet.

### Functions:
1. `confirm.emit()`: function - This function is likely an EventEmitter method that emits an event when the confirm button is clicked. The actual function name might differ, and `confirm` is likely an `EventEmitter` instance defined in the component class.

### Additional Notes:
- The `translate` pipe is used for internationalization, which suggests that there is a translation service being used. The actual service or mechanism is not shown in the snippet.
- The `mat-dialog-close` directive on the cancel button suggests that clicking the button will close the dialog. There is no additional function needed in the TypeScript file for this unless custom behavior is required on close.
- The `color="primary"` attribute on the confirm button suggests that there is a theme or styling convention being used, which is defined elsewhere in the application's styles or theme configuration.

### Example TypeScript (assuming the above):
```typescript
import { Component, EventEmitter, Output } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-confirm-dialog',
  templateUrl: './confirm-dialog.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./confirm-dialog.component.css']
})
export class ConfirmDialogComponent {
  // Variables
  message: string;

  // Constants (these could also be defined in a separate constants file or localization file)
  readonly CANCEL_LABEL: string = 'キャンセル';
  readonly CONFIRM_LABEL: string = '確認';

  // EventEmitter for confirm action
  @Output() confirm = new EventEmitter<void>();

  constructor() {
    // Initialization of variables if needed
    this.message = 'Your message here';
  }

  // Function to emit the confirm event
  onConfirm(): void {
    this.confirm.emit();
  }
}
```

In this example, the `onConfirm` function is created to wrap the `confirm.emit()` call, which is a common practice to encapsulate component logic within methods rather than directly in the template. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements of the application.
