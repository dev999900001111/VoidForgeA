Based on the provided HTML snippet, which is an Angular template for a footer toolbar, there are no explicit Angular-specific variables, constants, `ViewChild` references, or functions directly referenced within the HTML. However, I can infer some potential TypeScript class members that might be used in a component that would work with this template. Here's a list of potential members:

1. **Variables:**
   - There are no explicit variables in the HTML that would require corresponding TypeScript variables.

2. **Constants:**
   - `footerLinks`, `Array<{ label: string, path: string }>`: An array of objects representing the footer links, where each object contains a `label` for the display text and a `path` for the routing URL.

3. **ViewChild:**
   - There are no explicit Angular `ViewChild` references in the HTML that would require corresponding TypeScript `ViewChild` properties.

4. **Functions:**
   - There are no explicit functions in the HTML that would require corresponding TypeScript functions.

5. **MatTable Column Names:**
   - Since there is no `<mat-table>` element in the provided HTML, there are no column names to list as constants.

Here's an example of how the TypeScript class might look, including the `footerLinks` constant:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-footer',
  templateUrl: './footer.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./footer.component.css']
})
export class FooterComponent {
  // Constants
  readonly footerLinks: Array<{ label: string, path: string }> = [
    { label: 'ヘルプ / サポート', path: '/help-support' },
    { label: '利用規約', path: '/terms-of-service' },
    { label: 'プライバシーポリシー', path: '/privacy-policy' },
    { label: 'お問い合わせ', path: '/contact' }
  ];

  // There are no explicit variables, ViewChild, or functions in the provided HTML.
}
```

In this example, `footerLinks` is a constant array that holds the information for each footer link. This array could be used in the HTML template with an `*ngFor` directive to dynamically generate the footer links. However, since the HTML snippet provided does not use any Angular-specific features like property binding, event binding, or structural directives, there are no other TypeScript members required.
