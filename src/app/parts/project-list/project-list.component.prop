Here's a list of the potential variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that might be needed in the TypeScript component to support the provided Angular template:

Variables:
- `projects`, `Array<{id: string, name: string, description: string, thumbnail?: string}>`, An array of project objects that contains the id, name, description, and an optional thumbnail property for each project.

Constants:
- There are no explicit constants in the provided HTML, but if we consider the mat-table's column names as constants, they might be something like:
  - `COLUMN_NAMES`, `string[]`, An array of strings representing the column names for a mat-table, which could include 'thumbnail', 'name', 'description', 'edit', and 'delete'.

ViewChild:
- There are no ViewChild decorators used in the provided HTML snippet. However, if there were elements in the template that needed to be accessed directly in the TypeScript code, they would be listed here with the ViewChild decorator.

Functions:
- `select.emit`, `(project: any) => void`, A function that emits an event when the edit button is clicked, passing the selected project as an argument.
- `delete.emit`, `(projectId: string) => void`, A function that emits an event when the delete button is clicked, passing the project's id as an argument.

Please note that the actual implementation details such as the types for the `project` object or the exact signature of the `select.emit` and `delete.emit` functions may vary based on the broader application context. The above descriptions are based on the provided HTML snippet and common Angular patterns.
