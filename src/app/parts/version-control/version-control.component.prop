Based on the provided HTML snippet, here is a list of the variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that would be needed in the TypeScript component (`VersionControlComponent.ts`) to support the template:

### Variables:
1. `versions`, `Array<{versionNumber: string, createdAt: Date}>` - An array of objects where each object contains a `versionNumber` string and a `createdAt` Date that represents the version history of a project.

### Constants:
1. No explicit constants are defined in the HTML snippet. However, if the column names for a `mat-table` were to be included, they would be defined as constants in the TypeScript file. For example:
   - `displayedColumns`, `string[]` - An array of strings representing the column names for a `mat-table`. This is not present in the HTML snippet but would be used in a `mat-table` context.

### ViewChild:
1. No `ViewChild` is used in the provided HTML snippet. `ViewChild` is an Angular decorator that allows one to access a child component, directive, or DOM element from the parent component class. Since there is no child component or DOM element referenced with a template variable (`#var`), we do not have a `ViewChild` to list here.

### Functions:
1. `revert.emit`, `Function` - A function that is called when the revert button is clicked. It emits an event with the selected version object as its payload. This function would be part of an `EventEmitter` in the TypeScript file and is not a standalone function. It would be defined as:
   - `revert`, `EventEmitter<{versionNumber: string, createdAt: Date}>` - An instance of `EventEmitter` used to emit the selected version when the revert button is clicked.

### Additional Notes:
- The `mat-icon`, `mat-list-item`, `mat-list-icon`, and other `mat-` prefixed elements are Angular Material components and do not directly translate to TypeScript variables or functions. They are used in the template for rendering purposes.
- The `*ngFor` directive is used to loop over the `versions` array and render a list item for each version.
- The `date` pipe is used to format the `createdAt` date according to the Japanese locale. This is a built-in Angular pipe and does not require a specific TypeScript variable or function to be defined in the component class.
- The `aria-label` attribute in the button is for accessibility and does not require a TypeScript counterpart.

Please note that the actual TypeScript code would include additional elements such as imports, the component decorator with metadata, and possibly other lifecycle hooks or services depending on the broader context of the component's functionality.
