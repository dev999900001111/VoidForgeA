<!-- **Notes:**
- I've used `mat-card` to encapsulate the sharing settings, which is a common Angular Material component for displaying content and actions on a single topic.
- The `*ngFor` directive is used to iterate over the `permissions` array provided by the `@Input`.
- The `mat-list-item` is used to display each collaborator's information and their respective toggle for editing permissions.
- The `mat-slide-toggle` is used to allow the user to toggle the editing permission for each collaborator. The `checked` property is bound to a condition that checks if the current permission level is 'EDITOR'.
- The `(change)` event on the `mat-slide-toggle` emits an update event with the new permission level when toggled.
- I've used pipes `userName` and `permissionLevel` as placeholders for translating the user ID to a user name and permission level to a human-readable format, respectively. These would need to be implemented in the component or as custom pipes.
- The `update.emit` method is called without specifying the name of the `@Output` as per the instructions.
- The text is in Japanese as per the requirement.

**Assumptions:**
- Custom pipes `userName` and `permissionLevel` are assumed to be available for translating IDs to names and permission levels to readable text.
- The `update` method is assumed to be the method bound to the `@Output` event emitter in the component class.
- The `Permission` model is assumed to have a `userId` and `permissionLevel` property based on the provided model classes. -->
