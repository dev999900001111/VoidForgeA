Based on the provided HTML snippet, here is a list of the variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that would be needed in the corresponding TypeScript component file to make this template functional:

### Variables:
- `permissions`: `Permission[]`, An array of permission objects that contains the user ID and permission level for each collaborator.
- `update`: `EventEmitter<{userId: string, permissionLevel: string}>`, An event emitter that emits an event when the permission level for a user is changed.

### Constants:
- There are no explicit constants defined in the HTML snippet provided. However, if we consider the mat-table's column names as constants, they would be:
  - `USER_COLUMN`: `string`, The name of the column displaying the user's name.
  - `PERMISSION_COLUMN`: `string`, The name of the column displaying the permission level.
  - `TOGGLE_COLUMN`: `string`, The name of the column containing the slide toggle for editing permissions.

### ViewChild:
- There are no `ViewChild` references indicated in the HTML snippet provided. However, if there were elements that needed direct access within the component, they would be listed here with their respective types and descriptions.

### Functions:
- `userName`: `PipeTransform`, A custom pipe function that takes a user ID and returns the corresponding user name.
- `permissionLevel`: `PipeTransform`, A custom pipe function that takes a permission level value and returns a human-readable permission level string.

### Additional Assumptions:
- The `Permission` model is assumed to be an interface or class with at least the following properties:
  - `userId`: `string`, The unique identifier for a user.
  - `permissionLevel`: `string`, The permission level assigned to the user, such as 'EDITOR' or 'VIEWER'.

### Example TypeScript Component Class:
```typescript
import { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from '@angular/core';
import { PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

interface Permission {
  userId: string;
  permissionLevel: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-sharing-settings',
  templateUrl: './sharing-settings.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./sharing-settings.component.css']
})
export class SharingSettingsComponent {
  @Input() permissions: Permission[];
  @Output() update = new EventEmitter<{userId: string, permissionLevel: string}>();

  // Assuming userName and permissionLevel are implemented elsewhere as pipes
  // and are just used here for the sake of completeness.
  userName: PipeTransform; // Placeholder for the actual pipe implementation
  permissionLevel: PipeTransform; // Placeholder for the actual pipe implementation

  // Constants for mat-table's column names (if applicable)
  readonly USER_COLUMN: string = 'User';
  readonly PERMISSION_COLUMN: string = 'Permission';
  readonly TOGGLE_COLUMN: string = 'Toggle';

  // Function to emit the update event when the permission level is changed
  onPermissionChange(userId: string, isChecked: boolean): void {
    const permissionLevel = isChecked ? 'EDITOR' : 'VIEWER';
    this.update.emit({userId, permissionLevel});
  }
}
```

Note: The actual implementation of the `userName` and `permissionLevel` pipes is not provided here, as they are placeholders for custom pipe implementations that would need to be defined elsewhere in the application.
