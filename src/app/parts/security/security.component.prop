To create the TypeScript component for the provided Angular template, we would need to define several variables, constants, ViewChild references, and functions. Below is a list of potential items that might be needed:

### Variables:
1. `currentPassword`, `string`, The model for the current password input field.
2. `newPassword`, `string`, The model for the new password input field.
3. `confirmNewPassword`, `string`, The model for the new password confirmation input field.

### Constants:
1. `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`, `number`, The minimum length required for the new password.
2. `PASSWORD_REGEX`, `RegExp`, The regular expression pattern that the new password must match, including numeric and special characters.

### ViewChild:
1. `passwordForm`, `NgForm`, A reference to the password change form to access its properties and methods.

### Functions:
1. `openTwoFactorAuthDialog`, `(): void`, Opens the dialog for setting up two-factor authentication.
2. `changePassword`, `(): void`, Submits the password change form and handles the password update logic.

### Mat-Table Column Names (if applicable):
Since there is no `<mat-table>` in the provided HTML, there are no column names to list as constants. However, if there were a table, each column name would be listed here as a constant for reference in the TypeScript file.

Please note that the actual implementation may require additional variables, constants, ViewChild references, and functions depending on the specific requirements and functionalities of the SecurityComponent. The above list is based on the provided HTML and the typical needs for such a form.
