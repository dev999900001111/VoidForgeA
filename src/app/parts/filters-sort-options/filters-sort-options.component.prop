Below is a list of the variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that would be needed in the TypeScript component class to support the provided Angular template. Note that the actual types and descriptions may vary based on the specific use case and data structures used in the application.

### Variables:
- `selectedCategory: string` - Holds the currently selected category value for binding with the category dropdown.
- `selectedDate: string` - Holds the currently selected date value for binding with the date dropdown.
- `selectedStatus: string` - Holds the currently selected status value for binding with the status dropdown.
- `selectedSort: string` - Holds the currently selected sort value for binding with the sort dropdown.
- `categories: Array<{ value: string, viewValue: string }>` - An array of objects representing the available categories for the category dropdown.
- `dates: Array<{ value: string, viewValue: string }>` - An array of objects representing the available dates for the date dropdown.
- `statuses: Array<{ value: string, viewValue: string }>` - An array of objects representing the available statuses for the status dropdown.
- `sorts: Array<{ value: string, viewValue: string }>` - An array of objects representing the available sorting options for the sort dropdown.

### Constants:
- `COLUMN_NAMES: string[]` - An array of strings representing the column names for the mat-table.

### ViewChild:
- No `ViewChild` is explicitly required from the provided HTML template. However, if there is a need to interact with the `mat-select` elements directly from the TypeScript code, `ViewChild` decorators could be used to access them.

### Functions:
- `update.emit(event: { type: string, value: any }): void` - This function would be part of an `EventEmitter` that emits an event when a selection is made in any of the dropdowns. The event object contains the type of filter and the selected value.

### Additional Notes:
- The actual implementation may require additional functions for initialization, data fetching, and other interactions not specified in the HTML template.
- The types for the variables may need to be adjusted based on the actual data types used in the application (e.g., `string`, `number`, `Date`, custom types, etc.).
- The `update` method mentioned in the HTML is assumed to be an `EventEmitter` that is part of the component class, which should be declared and initialized.
- The `EventEmitter` should be decorated with `@Output()` if it is intended to emit events to parent components.

Here is an example of how the `EventEmitter` and one of the variables might be declared in the TypeScript class:

```typescript
import { Component, EventEmitter, Output } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-your-component',
  templateUrl: './your-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./your-component.component.css']
})
export class YourComponent {
  // Variables
  selectedCategory: string;
  categories: Array<{ value: string, viewValue: string }>;

  // Constants
  readonly COLUMN_NAMES: string[] = ['columnName1', 'columnName2', 'columnName3'];

  // EventEmitter
  @Output() update: EventEmitter<{ type: string, value: any }> = new EventEmitter();

  // Functions
  emitUpdate(type: string, value: any): void {
    this.update.emit({ type, value });
  }
}
```

This is a simplified example and does not include all the variables and functions that would be needed. The actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements and logic of the application.
