Based on the provided Angular template, here is a list of the required variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that would be needed in the corresponding TypeScript component class:

Variables:
- `suggestions`, `Array<any>`, An array that holds the suggestion objects to be displayed in the `mat-grid-list`.
- `error`, `boolean`, A flag indicating whether there is an error loading the suggestions.

Constants:
- There are no explicit constants defined in the HTML template. However, if the column names for a `mat-table` are needed (not shown in the provided HTML), they would typically be defined as an array of strings in the TypeScript file. For example:
  - `displayedColumns`, `string[]`, An array of strings representing the column names for the `mat-table`.

ViewChild:
- There are no `ViewChild` references indicated in the provided HTML template. However, if there were elements or components that needed to be accessed directly in the TypeScript class, they would be annotated with `@ViewChild`.

Functions:
- `select.emit`, `Function`, A method that emits the selected suggestion object when a grid tile is clicked. This would typically be part of an `EventEmitter` property in the TypeScript class, for example:
  - `select`, `EventEmitter<any>`, An instance of `EventEmitter` used to emit the selected suggestion to the parent component when a grid tile is clicked.

The TypeScript class might look something like this (simplified example):

```typescript
import { Component, EventEmitter, Output } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-suggestions',
  templateUrl: './suggestions.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./suggestions.component.css']
})
export class SuggestionsComponent {
  // Variables
  suggestions: any[] = []; // Replace `any` with a more specific type if possible
  error: boolean = false;

  // Constants for mat-table (if applicable)
  displayedColumns: string[] = ['column1', 'column2', 'column3']; // Example column names

  // EventEmitter for selected suggestion
  @Output() select: EventEmitter<any> = new EventEmitter<any>();

  // Functions
  onTileClick(suggestion: any): void {
    this.select.emit(suggestion);
  }
}
```

Please note that the actual types for `suggestions` and the `EventEmitter` should be more specific and match the data structure of the suggestions being used. The `onTileClick` function is an example of how the `(click)` event binding might be implemented in the TypeScript class.
