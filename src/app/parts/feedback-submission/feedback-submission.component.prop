Here's a list of the variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that would be needed in the TypeScript file to support the provided Angular template:

### Variables:
1. `feedback`: Object - An object to hold the feedback content that is bound to the textarea via `ngModel`.

### Constants:
1. `MIN_FEEDBACK_LENGTH`: number - A constant to define the minimum length of the feedback content. This could be used in place of the hardcoded '10' in the `minlength` validator.

### ViewChild:
1. `feedbackForm`: NgForm - A reference to the form instance in the template, accessed via the `#feedbackForm` template reference variable. This is used to interact with the form programmatically.

### Functions:
1. `submit`: EventEmitter<any> - An event emitter function that emits the form value when the form is submitted. The type `any` can be replaced with a more specific type or interface that represents the structure of the feedback form's data.

### Additional Notes:
- The `full-width` and `feedback-submit-button` classes mentioned in the notes would be defined in the component's CSS and are not part of the TypeScript file.
- The `mat-table` column names are not present in the provided HTML snippet. If they were, they would be constants representing the identifiers for each column in the table.

Here's an example of how the TypeScript code might look:

```typescript
import { Component, EventEmitter, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { NgForm } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-feedback-form',
  templateUrl: './feedback-form.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./feedback-form.component.css']
})
export class FeedbackFormComponent {
  @ViewChild('feedbackForm') feedbackForm: NgForm;
  feedback = {
    content: ''
  };
  submit = new EventEmitter<any>();

  MIN_FEEDBACK_LENGTH = 10;

  onSubmit() {
    if (this.feedbackForm.valid) {
      this.submit.emit(this.feedbackForm.value);
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, `onSubmit` is a method that could be called when the form is submitted, checking if the form is valid before emitting the form value. The `MIN_FEEDBACK_LENGTH` constant is used to define the minimum length of the feedback content, which could be used in the template and in any validation logic within the TypeScript file.
