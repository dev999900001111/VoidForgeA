// 
// Please note that the `SavePublishDialogComponent` is assumed to be a component that exists in the application and is responsible for handling the save and publish dialog interactions. The `SavePublishDialogComponent` would need to be created separately and should emit an event when the user decides to save or publish the project.
// 
// Also, the `onSave` and `onPublish` methods are placeholders for the actual save and publish logic. The `onSave` method should be connected to a button in the template that triggers the save process, and the `onPublish` method should be connected to a button that opens the publish dialog.
// 
// The `publishProject` method is private because it is an implementation detail of the `ProjectCreationEditComponent` and should not be exposed to other components.
// 
// The `ProjectService` is injected into the component to interact with the backend services for creating, updating, and publishing projects. The `MatDialog` service from Angular Material is used to open the dialog component.
// 
// The `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook initializes a new project if the `project` input is not provided. This allows the component to be used for both creating new projects and editing existing ones.
// 
// The `onSave` and `onPublish` methods are connected to their respective buttons in the component's template, which is not shown here but would include the necessary Angular Material components and bindings to make the UI functional and user-friendly.
