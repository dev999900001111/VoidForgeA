Below is a list of the required variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that would be needed in the TypeScript file to support the provided Angular template. Note that the actual implementation details and types are assumed based on the context provided by the HTML template.

### Variables:
1. `user`, Type: `User`, Description: An object representing the current user, to be passed to the `app-header` component.
2. `projects`, Type: `Project[]`, Description: An array of project objects to be displayed in the grid list.

### Constants:
1. `COLUMN_NAMES`, Type: `string[]`, Description: An array of strings representing the column names for the `mat-table`, if applicable. (Note: The provided HTML does not include a `mat-table`, so this constant is not directly relevant to the given code.)

### ViewChild:
(None specified in the provided HTML, but if there were elements that needed direct access, they would be listed here.)

### Functions:
1. `onLogout`, Type: `Function`, Description: A method to handle the logout event emitted by the `app-header`.
2. `openConfirmationDialog`, Type: `Function`, Parameters: `projectId: string`, Description: A method to open a confirmation dialog when the user attempts to delete a project.
3. `navigateToProjectCreation`, Type: `Function`, Description: A method to navigate the user to the `ProjectCreationEditComponent` for creating a new project.
4. `select.emit`, Type: `Function`, Parameters: `project: Project`, Description: An EventEmitter method that emits the selected project when the edit button is clicked.

### Additional Notes:
- The `select` variable would be an `EventEmitter<Project>` instance if it is intended to emit the selected project to a parent component.
- The `Project` type mentioned in the variables and functions would be an interface or class representing the project data structure, which should include at least `name`, `description`, `thumbnailUrl`, and `updatedAt` properties.
- The `User` type mentioned in the variables would be an interface or class representing the user data structure.
- The actual implementation of the `ConfirmationDialog` and how it is opened would require additional code not specified in the HTML, such as a dialog service or component.
- The `navigateToProjectCreation` function would likely use Angular's `Router` service to navigate to the appropriate route.
- The `mat-icon` and `mat-fab` indicate that Material Icons should be included in the project dependencies.
- The `date` pipe used in the template suggests that the `DatePipe` from `@angular/common` should be imported and provided if custom date formatting is required in the TypeScript code.
