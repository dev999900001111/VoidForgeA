Here's a list of the variables, constants, ViewChild, and functions that would be needed in the TypeScript file (`app.component.ts`) to support the provided Angular template:

1. Variables:
   - `user`, Type: `User`, Description: An object representing the logged-in user's information. This would typically include properties like name, email, etc.

2. Constants:
   - No explicit constants are defined in the HTML template for the `mat-table` column names. However, if a `mat-table` were to be used within the `router-outlet`, you would define constants for the column names in the component that contains the `mat-table`.

3. ViewChild:
   - `sidenav`, Type: `MatSidenav`, Description: A reference to the `MatSidenav` instance to control its open and close behavior programmatically.

4. Functions:
   - `onLogout`, Type: `Function`, Description: A method to be called when the user clicks the logout button. This function would handle the logic for logging the user out of the application.

Please note that the actual implementation details, such as the `User` type or the `MatSidenav` type, would depend on the specific application and its dependencies. The `User` type would typically be an interface or a class defined in the application to model the user data, and `MatSidenav` is a component provided by Angular Material.
